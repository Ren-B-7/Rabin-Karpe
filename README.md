## Improved? Rabin-Karpe substring search

This is a different implementation to the Rabin-Karpe substring search, it requires more preprocessing, but it is faster once the processing is done, thus it is faster on longer words and longer substrings.

It was made by me personally while at Stellenbosch, some of the code was also changed/ improved by some lecturers/ researchers at the university, it was not required to be made by the course but i wanted to see if I can improv on the existing Rabin-Karpe substring search method
